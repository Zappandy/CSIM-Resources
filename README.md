# CSIM-Resources

Hello CSIMers! 

On this repo, that I'll try to update and improve every month, I'll add resources that you can rely on for your work and studies in the program. Bear in mind that this is coming from someone who pursued his thesis at **specs**. Therefore, this information may be biased to the work I did at the lab. Having said that, I believe for work with an intensive coding load this can be extremely useful regardless of the lab or project you're working in. I'd like to stress that it is *impossible* to go through all of the material while pursuing the program and working on your thesis. Even so, I hope you find this handy and choose wisely which material you'd like to dive in during your time at UPF.

Above all else, I'd like for you to see this as a resource for learning in the future if you decide to remain working in research, computer science, cognitive science or an akin field.

I will divide this in different sections.

- Programming
- Statistics and Research Methods
- Cognitive Science
- Math
- Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning

## Programming resources

It is expected that you know how to code, but if for some reason that is something you struggle with I can recommend the following resources:

### Programming Languages for systems and analysis

This shouldn't matter as much but I can say based on my experience that some familiarity with **C#** and **Unity** is recommended, especially if you are working with VR or mixed reality systems.

The youtube channel [**Brackeys**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik) provides a friendly introduction to several Unity tools, this applies to the [**SpeedTutor**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb34wPRpZdVeH_kW-jY5PP2Mu1llYR5Jk) channel as well. Additionally Unity provides basic tutorials you can follow. If you are familiar with **C** or **C++** I think you can skip this. Although these languages are indeed quite different, syntax remains similar and there's other skills you may rather iron out.

For analysis, there's a plethora of tools. If you are already proficient in **R**, **Matlab**, or **Python** you can skip this section. Just use one. They are all really good and honestly you can use most languages to scrape and analyze data. However, if you are NOT familiar with any language for data analysis, I highly recommend picking up any of the aforementioned ones. I personally prefer **Python** mostly due to its libraries.

#### Python

The [Edx Python course is good](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) and much more useful if you want to further dwell in computer science. Quick practice tools that you can use are [solo learn](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/) and this is a nice summary of [data analysis in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)

Data analysis and visualization may vary depending on the signal you are dealing with. If for some reason you are working with **EEG** then there's the **MNE** library. It's quite powerful. There are different tutorials that have come out in recent times further exploring it:

Python's strength is its libraries and as such be sure to implement them effectively.

#### Matlab and R

Both of these are great tools. I do not have resources for them, but I'm aware that Matlab is great for analysis of neurophysical data and R for general data analysis. Coming across courses for the latter is easy.

### Programming and writing your thesis

"Wait, couldn't I just use google docs?" I hear you say. I mean yes, but that's not particularly efficient. Now you do NOT want to waste time learning a bevy of tools that you may not end up using in the future. HOWEVER, there are much better tools for taking notes. 

### IDEs and text editors

Vim, emacs, visual studio, pycharm?

### Computational thinking

I'm a big proponent of computational thinking as a transferable skill for any logic based project. Whether your work is code heavy or not, if you develop this skill tackling research problems should be definitely more manageable. I highly doubt that you can focus on this during the course of the program, but it's something I encourage you to develop, especially if you want to do further work in computer science. The first Python course is amazing at that and so is [Harvard's introduction to computer science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)


## Contact Info

I'll try to update this often. If you have specific questions and want to get in touch with me, you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Zappangon). Out of an abundance of caution for my privacy I won't share my email, but you can ask the head of the program Marti, professor Belen, or my Master thesis supervisor Martina for my email address and I'll gladly get back to you as soon as I can.
